# Week 1 — Linear Regression



This folder contains the experiments and notebooks created as part of \*\*Week 1\*\* of the AI Research Journey.  

The focus for this week is understanding and implementing \*\*Linear Regression\*\*, visualizing data, and preparing a reproducible experiment workflow.



---



##  Notebook: `linear\_regression.ipynb`



### **Overview**

This notebook introduces the fundamentals of \*\*Linear Regression\*\*, one of the simplest and most important models in Machine Learning.  

It is designed to help understand:



- What linear regression is  

- How data behaves in a regression problem  

- How to generate synthetic data  

- Basic data visualization  

- Preparing the environment for reproducible experiments  



This notebook is part of the **Day 3 task** in the project timeline.

##  What This Notebook Contains



### 1. **Setup \& Imports**

Initial configuration including:

- numpy  

- pandas  

- matplotlib  

- scikit-learn  



A reproducible `seed = 42` is set.



---



### 2. **Synthetic Dataset Generation**

We generate a simple dataset using:

##y = 4 + 3X + noise

This helps visualize how linear regression works without requiring any external dataset.



---



### 3. **Scatter Plot Visualization**

A basic scatter plot is included to observe the relationship between `X` and `y`.

##  How to Run the Notebook



### **Option 1 — Local Jupyter Notebook**

Run the following:


pip install -r ../../requirements.txt

jupyter notebook


Then open:



notebooks/week1/linear\_regression.ipynb



markdown

Copy code



### **Option 2 — Google Colab\**

1\. Upload the notebook  

2\. Upload `requirements.txt` or run:
